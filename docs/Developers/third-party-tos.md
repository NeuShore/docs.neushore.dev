   - This is to prevent a bloated amount of public servers from popping up and allowing community members to personally experience a developer's talents

5. You are not allowed to publish addons explicitly made another Third Party Developer under any conditions.

   - BrayanBot Discord Server
   - Your own support server after meeting the requirements to create one
   - Discord Private Messages
