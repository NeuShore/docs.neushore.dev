# Support
---
## Basic Etiquette

You, during the time frame you are using BrayanBot, are eligible **but not entitled** for support. We may refuse to provide support anytime, for any reason. You are expected to understand and act accordingly.


### Usage Support

We will do our best to answer your questions about basic usage of BrayanBot; but we expect you to be patient as we are human beings and all developers/maintainers/support team members have their own personal schedule. We may not respond instantly, and you should not repeatedly ping any of those providing support for instant answers.

### Programming Support

As BrayanBot is open-source and contribution-driven, we may provide support for programming. Again, we may not respond immediately and we expect you to to respect our schedules.


### Denial of Support

If you act like an entitled child around the support server, you may (and most likely *will*) be denied from receiving support indefinitely.
